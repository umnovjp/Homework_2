02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Description. I created a web based portfolio of my previous work to show my potential employer. The website presents my name, photo, and links to sections. When potential employer clicks the links in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When potential employer clicks on the link to the section about my work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of products I developed or tested in the past. My first product image is larger thatn four others. When he clicks on the images in all five products he is taken to that product. 
Resize function does not work correctly yet. But I will correct it soon. I submitted on time. I will add that functionality in few days. Navigation bar and header picture do not look nice yet. I will improve in few days. 

Credits. I took basic layout idea from 06-Stu_Responsive-design uploaded to Bootcamp Content website by Cody Clark.
